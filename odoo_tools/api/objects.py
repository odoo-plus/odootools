    When creating a new database, it is possible to configure the
    main company before installing more modules. One example where
    the company is particularly important is when you attempt to
    install the account module.

    Without a valid company, Odoo will try to install a default
    l10n module for accounting for a locale that you would likely
    not use.

    When a company object is provided to the database initialization,
    it will start by initializing the database with the base module.

    Then when the base module is installed, it will update some objects
    like the `res.company` and then it will install other modules that
    were requested to be installed for the database initialization.
